# Terraform Multi-Cloud Security Monitoring

## Overview

## Project Goals

This project demonstrates how to build a **multi-cloud security monitoring architecture** using Terraform.

The objective is to simulate how a security engineering team might deploy centralized monitoring across multiple cloud providers.

Key goals of the project:

- Deploy security telemetry collection in AWS and Azure
- Centralize cloud activity logging
- Detect suspicious activity using log analytics
- Trigger automated security alerts
- Demonstrate Infrastructure as Code using Terraform
- Build a realistic cloud security engineering portfolio project

## AWS Monitoring Architecture

CloudTrail → API activity logs  
S3 → centralized log storage  
CloudWatch Logs → log ingestion  
Metric Filters → detect suspicious activity  
CloudWatch Alarms → security alerts  
SNS → alert notifications

## Terraform Deployment Workflow

The infrastructure in this project was deployed using the standard Terraform workflow.

```
Developer
   │
   ▼
Terraform Configuration (.tf files)
   │
   ▼
terraform init
   │
   ▼
terraform plan
   │
   ▼
terraform apply
   │
   ▼
Cloud Infrastructure Created
   │
   ▼
AWS Security Monitoring Pipeline
CloudTrail → S3 → CloudWatch → Metric Filters → CloudWatch Alarms
```

### Terraform Commands Used

```
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
terraform state list
```

This workflow ensures that infrastructure changes are reviewed before deployment and remain reproducible using Infrastructure as Code.
Additional monitoring components:

GuardDuty → threat detection  
AWS Config → configuration monitoring  
VPC Flow Logs → network monitoring  

---

## Azure Monitoring Architecture

Activity Logs → platform events  
Diagnostic Settings → log forwarding  
Log Analytics Workspace → centralized log storage  
Azure Monitor Alerts → security alerts  
Action Groups → notification routing  

Additional monitoring components:

Defender for Cloud → threat detection  
Azure Policy → compliance monitoring  
NSG Flow Logs → network monitoring
